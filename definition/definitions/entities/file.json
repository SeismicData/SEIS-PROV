    "description": "In some cases arbitrary files are needed to describe the provenance of something. Examples are special source code files who's information cannot be represented in the ``Input Parameter`` entity. This entity allows to refer to arbitrary files. Each file is represented by a filename, a location, and a location type. The location might be a URL; then provenance discovery is simple. It might also be a filename or a path in a container format. Users are responsible to either ship the files alongside the provenance information or provide access by other means.",
